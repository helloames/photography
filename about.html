                    <p>Hi! I'm Amy. I'm a Durham-based photographer and Duke student. I’m studying Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Religion, and I’m currently the Photo Editor of The Chronicle, the student newspaper. I was previously the News Photo Editor, and I covered stories ranging from Governor Tim Walz and President Clinton on the Harris campaign trail to March Madness for Duke Men’s Basketball.</p>
                    <p>Outside of photojournalism, I often shoot graduation photos for Duke seniors! For Summer 2025 and Spring 2026 inquiries, please reach me at <a href="mailto:amy.zhang@duke.edu">amy.zhang@duke.edu</a>. Graduation photo session spots (for groups and individuals) are opened once the previous academic semester ends.</p>
                    <p>I’m also on the hunt for software engineering intern roles for Summer 2026. Past experiences include full-stack development projects sponsored by Apple, front-end software engineering at Duke's CFCI, and research on nuclear conflict modeling using machine learning. For Summer 2025, I'm interning at Fidelity as a software engineering intern.</p>
                    <p>Whether behind the camera or behind the keyboard, I’m drawn to building things that tell meaningful stories and make an impact. Feel free to reach out!</p>
